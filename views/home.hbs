    <p class="name">Pyraminx</p>
    The Pyraminx is a triangular pyramid-shaped (or tetrahedron) puzzle. 
    The parts are arranged in a pyramidal pattern on each side of the puzzle. 
    The layers can be rotated with respect to each vertex, and the individual tips can be rotated as well. 
    It was designed by Uwe Meffert in 1970, but was nothing was done with the design until he brought it to Hong Kong 
    for production after seeing the success of the Rubik's Cube.
    The Pyraminx has 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips, and a total of 3,732,480 different possible combinations. 
    Every position can be solved in a maximum of 11 moves.
    The world record for the fastest single solve is 0.91 seconds held by a Dominik Gorny. 
    The World record average is 1.86 seconds held by Tymon Kolasiński.

    <p class="name">Megaminx</p>
    The Megaminx is made in the shape of a dodecahedron, and has 12 faces and center pieces, 20 corner pieces, and 30 edge pieces. 
    The face centers each have a single color, which identifies the color of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colors, and the corner pieces have three. 
    Each face contains a center piece, 5 corner pieces and 5 edge pieces. The corner and edge pieces are shared with adjacent faces. 
    The face centers can only rotate in place, but the other pieces can be permuted by twisting the face layer around the face center.
    There are two main versions of the Megaminx: one with 6 colors, with opposite faces having the same color, and one with 12 different colors. 
    The 12-color Megaminx is the only type legal in official WCA competitions, and is therefore much more popular than the 6-color version.
    The objective of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore it to its original state of having one color per face.
